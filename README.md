## **ML Using Support Vector Machines & Random Forests & and Neural Networks**

### **Strategy:**

1. Pair the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and identify the 10 pairs with the highest cointegration (i.e., the smallest p-value) as investment targets.

2. Train a model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method and calculate the annualized return.

3. Train a model using the Random Forest (RF) method and calculate the annualized return.

4. Train a model using the Neural Network (NN) method and calculate the annualized return.

The average annual return from these three methods is then calculated for comparison.
